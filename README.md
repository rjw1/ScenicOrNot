## What is Scenic-or-Not?

It’s a game — pit your aesthetic judgements against other users, and discover the lovely and not so lovely corners of Great Britain.

## Where are all the pictures from?

The lovely people at [Geograph](http://www.geograph.org.uk/).

## Why did you build it?

Originally, [mySociety](http://www.mysociety.org/) wanted to gather a freely available nationwide dataset of scenicness, to use for [mapumental](https://mapumental.com/). Now, the [Data Science Lab](http://www.datasciencelab.co.uk/) at [Warwick Business School](http://www.wbs.ac.uk/) have taken over Scenic-or-Not in order to research how scenicness impacts on human wellbeing.

## How can I find out more about this scenicness research?

Here are the latest papers using the scenicness data:

## Can I download the data generated by Scenic-or-Not?

Sure, we’re happy to make the data available for other people to use under the [Open Database Licence](http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/).

[votes.tsv](http://scenicornot.datasciencelab.co.uk/votes.tsv) is a TSV file of all photos that have been rated 3 times or more. The columns are ID, latitude, longitude, average rating, population variance, the votes (comma separated), and the Geograph URI for the photo. The current file contains all the votes posted until February 2015.

There are 217,000 images (one for each of nearly 95% of the 1km grid squares in Great Britain), and we’re making sure each one is rated 3 times by different people, to help limit abuse, or the impact of people with terrible taste.

## Who built it?

Scenic-or-Not was originally built by [The Dextrous Web (now Dextrous Digital)](https://www.dxw.com/) for [mySociety](http://www.mysociety.org/). It is now hosted by the [Data Science Lab](http://datasciencelab.co.uk/) at [Warwick Business School](http://www.wbs.ac.uk/).
